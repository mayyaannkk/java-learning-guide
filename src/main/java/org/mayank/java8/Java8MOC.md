# Java 8

## Why Java 8?

- For technological advancements
- Java creators wanted to introduce the Functional features:
    - Lambdas
    - Streams
    - Optional
- New java 8 features simplify the concurrency operations


## Functional programming
 
- Embraces creating immutable objects
- More concise and readable code
- Using functions/methods as first class citizens
- Write code using *Declarative approach*

Example::
```java
Function<String, String> addSomething = (name) -> name.toUpperCase().concat("default")
```

**Imperative style of programming**
- Focuses on how to perform the operations
- Embraces object mutability
- This style of programming lists the step-by-step instruction on how something needs to be done.
- We need to write all the steps that need to be taken
- Classic object-oriented programming uses imperative style.

**Declarative style of programming**
- Focuses on what needs to be done, what is the result that you want.
- Embraces object immutability
- Analogous to SQL
- Functional programming uses the concept of declarative programming
