# Consumer
Consumer basically takes a single input argument and consumes it, and has a void return type. So there is nothing returned from the Consumer.

Consumer is just a SAM Interface whose implementation we are providing each time when we create a Consumer and pass a lambda function. That lambda function is the overriding method code.

## Bi-Consumer
Similar to Consumer, it just takes in 2 input argument.
